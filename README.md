# Minishell - 42 Project

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Minishell** is a project at 42 that involves creating a custom shell program in **C**. The goal is to implement a functional shell that can handle basic command execution, redirection, piping, and environment variable management, while parsing input efficiently. A key part of this project is building an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) to parse the user input before processing it.

### Bonus Features
In addition to basic shell functionalities, I implemented the following bonus features:

- **Wildcards (Globbing)**: Supports the use of wildcards like `*` and `?` in filenames for pattern matching.
- **Command Grouping with Parentheses (`()`)**: Allows commands to be grouped and executed within a subshell.
- **Input Parsing with an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)**: Instead of directly processing the input, the shell constructs an AST, which simplifies command handling, operator precedence, and redirection.

## 💡 Key Features & Bonus Implementations

### Basic Shell Functionality

- **Abstract Syntax Tree**: Parses the user input creating an abstract syntax tree for execution
- **Command Execution**: Reads user input, parses it, and executes commands accordingly.
- **Pipes**: Supports piping between commands using `|` to pass the output of one command as input to another.
- **Redirections**: Handles redirection operators (`>`, `>>`, `<`) for both input and output redirection.
- **Environment Variables**: Supports environment variable management, including setting, unsetting, and displaying them.
- **Built-in Commands**: Handles built-in commands like `cd`, `echo`, `pwd`, `env`, `export`, `unset`, and `exit`.

### 📜 Bonus Features

1. **Wildcards (Globbing)**:
   - The shell supports the use of wildcards like `*`, `?` in commands, enabling file pattern matching. For example:
     - `*.txt` matches all `.txt` files.
     - `file?.txt` matches files like `file1.txt`, `file2.txt`, etc.
   
2. **Command Grouping with Parentheses (`()`):**
   - Commands enclosed in parentheses are grouped and executed in a subshell. This allows users to run multiple commands in a single line, with the grouping affecting only the execution context inside the parentheses.
   - Example: `(cd /home; ls)` will first `cd` into `/home` and then execute `ls` in the same command.

## 🧑‍💻 Implementation Details

The project was developed using **C** and includes the following core functionalities:

- **Input Parsing (AST)**: The input string is parsed into an AST, which is a tree structure representing commands, operators, and redirections. This makes it easier to execute commands in the correct order.
- **Command Execution**: For each command, the shell creates child processes using `fork()` and `execvp()` for execution. Redirection and piping are handled by manipulating file descriptors using `dup2()`.
- **Wildcards**: The shell uses the `glob()` function to expand wildcard characters into matching filenames.
- **Signal Handling**: Custom handling of signals like `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C) and `SIGQUIT` ensures that the shell behaves correctly when interrupted.

## 🧑‍🔧 Compilation & Setup

To compile and set up the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/minishell.git
cd minishell
```

### 2. Compile the project
To compile the project and generate the executable, run:

```bash
make
```
This will create the minishell executable.

3. Clean up
To remove the object files:

```bash
make clean
```
To remove all compiled files, including the executable:

```bash
make fclean
```
To recompile everything from scratch:

```bash
make re
```

## 🧪 Example Usage
To use the minishell program, simply run it:

```bash
./minishell
```
This will launch the interactive shell. You can then enter commands like:

```bash
$ echo Hello World
$ cd /home/user
$ ls -l
```

## Wildcard Example
```bash
$ ls *.txt
```
This will list all files in the current directory with a .txt extension.

## Command Grouping Example
```bash
$ (cd /home; ls)
```
This will execute the cd command followed by ls in a subshell.

## 💡 Key Concepts & Challenges
AST Parsing: Handling complex input structures using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for better command parsing and execution.
Process Management: Creating child processes with fork() and executing commands with execvp(), while managing redirection and piping.
Signal Handling: Handling interruptions like SIGINT without crashing the shell.
Wildcard Expansion: Expanding wildcards in file paths using glob().
Command Grouping: Allowing commands to be grouped and executed in a subshell with parentheses.
